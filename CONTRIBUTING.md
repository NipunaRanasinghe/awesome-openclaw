Thank you for your interest in contributing to this awesome list! 🦞

## Guidelines

Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:

### Adding Items

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Add your item as a new row in the appropriate Markdown table in `README.md`, matching the existing column order and formatting.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short, simple, and descriptive.
- Match the existing punctuation style used in the table.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

### Link Requirements

- The link should be the most canonical/official source.
- The link should work and be accessible.
- Links to official documentation are preferred over third-party resources.

### Quality Standards

- The item must be related to OpenClaw.
- The item should provide value to the community.
- Only suggest something you have personally used or verified.
- Items should be actively maintained (if applicable).

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
3. Make your changes in the `README.md` file.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear title and description.
5. Wait for review and address any feedback.

### Updating Your Pull Request

If the maintainers notice anything that needs to be changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR; just edit the existing one.
